## DELi Roadmap

There are plenty new features and modules we would like to add to DELi.
Below is a *rough* outline of which features we hope to add and when we think they might get done

2025 Q4
- [ ] Non-uniform reactions for library enumeration
- [ ] Adding `reactions` to the DELi data directory to support better reaction management/readability
- [ ] Support for any filesystem using `fsspec`

2026 Q1
- [ ] Overhaul of analysis module, specifically the code class to be more generalizable to all file inputs (will result in a major version bump)
- [ ] Additional analysis and enrichment metrics surrounding disynthons
- [ ] Enhanced ML methods for analysis
- [ ] Support for clustering DELs using ``bblean``

2026 Q2
- [ ] Addition of DEL design module for compounds (not just tags)

The future
- [ ] More support for parallelization
- [ ] Maybe a GUI???
- [ ] Support for a SQL database to ingest DEL experiment tracking and selection data

If you have any more ideas feel free to raise a feature request on [our github](https://github.com/Popov-Lab-UNC/DELi)

Defining DELs for use in DELi
=============================

In order to use DELi to process your DEL data, DELi needs to know
some information about your DELs. It does this using two types of files:
:ref:`library files <defining_libraries>` (JSON format)
and :ref:`building block sets <defining_building_blocks>` (CSV format).
Nearly any DEL can be defined using these two file types (and if
yours cannot, please open an issue on the DELi GitHub repository to add support).

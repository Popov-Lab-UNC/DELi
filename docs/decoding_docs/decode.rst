DEL Decoding
============

DELi support decoding of raw DEL selection data (DNA sequences, or "reads") into DEL compound enrichment data (what
scientist use to find "hits"). This what the ``decode`` module in DELi handles.

Run Decoding
------------
DELi supplies both a command line interface (CLI) and a Python API for decoding DELs.
For most users, the CLI is the easiest way to decode DELs.
All you need to do is provide a :ref:`decoding run file <decoding-run-file-docs>` and DELi will
start decoding.

If you want to decode via the Python API you can use the ``DecodingRunner`` class. You can
get even more control over the decoding process by using if you want. Refer to the decoding
module API documentation for more details.

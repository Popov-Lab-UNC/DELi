    Numba accelerated inverse_indices calculation

    This is lifted from biopython/Bio/Align/__init__.py:inverse_indices:2961
    The inverse_indices attribute is actually a property for alignment objects
    in Biopython, meaning it is just run every time you try and access the
    inverse_indices attribute.
    It is the most expensive part of the alignment, although
    The code can be numba compiled to speed up the frequent calls
    to the function we have to make.
    This function does just that.
    A few changes to the exact functions were made, but the algorithm is the
    same, just compatible with njit now.

    Using njit makes this function about 5 times faster, and since it accounts for
    ~25% of the runtime during decoding, it offers tangible speed ups

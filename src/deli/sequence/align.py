    Parameters
    ----------
    seq1: str
        first sequence from alignment
    seq2: str
        second sequence from alignment
    alignment: List[Tuple[Optional[int], Optional[int]]]

        Globally align two sequences to each other

        Parameters
        ----------
        seq1: str
            sequence to be aligned
        seq2: str
            sequence to align to

        Returns
        -------
        alignment: list[(int, int)]
            the resulting global alignment of the two sequences

        Notes
        -----
        Uses the Needlemanâ€“Wunsch algorithm[1]_ to calculate the global alignment

        The alignment will be returned as a list of tuples.
        The tuples contain two elements: the index of the first sequence and
        the index of the second sequence that it was aligned to.
        If there is gap, one of the two index values will be `None`.

        For example, alignment:

        ACTG--C
        -CTGCCC

        would look like this:
        [(0, None), (1, 0), (2, 1), (3, 2), (None, 3), (None, 4), (4, 5)]

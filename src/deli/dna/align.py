        Align two sequences using a hybrid semi-global alignment

        Notes
        -----
        This is inspired by the cutadapt[1]_ approach for alignment.
        In this algorithm, the dynamic programming matrix is filling is
        guided by the "edit cost" which is the raw number of mismatches
        in the alignment. The directions to mover are also created from this
        table. At the same time, the a socre matrix is filled
        based on the status of the edit cost alignment.
        When picking an alignment, the score table is naviagted using the edit
        table directions.

        To avoid the aligner decided that a full gap between the two sequences
        is optimal, only the first sequence has not penalties for gaps.
        The second sequence will have all gaps penalized.

        This makes the Hyprid approach far better at aligning a small
        region to a much larger sequence. For example, for trying to find
        the adapter in region in a larger read (whicih is why cutadpat uses it)

        For the above reason, this should really only be used when demultiplexing
        in DELi, for example the LibraryCaller uses it. All other alignments
        should be done with the SemiGlobalAligner.

        Parameters
        ----------
        seq1: str
            sequence to be aligned
        seq2: str

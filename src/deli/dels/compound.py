    Abstract interface for low memory compound classes

    Low memory compounds are used to avoid excessive pointers/object usage when it is unnecessary.

    Rather than pointing to objects (like DELibrary or BuildingBlocks),
    this class stores info about a compound as the object string ids.
    As long as you have the DELibraryCollection object that originally contained these IDs,
    you can load the full DELCompound object again later on.

    This is useful when you need to save the compounds to a file,
    as they can be saved in an efficient text format.
    They can be converted to the full DELCompound object after loading,
    only requiring the DELibraryCollection object that they originated from.

    An example of where this is useful is when trying to merge several DEL counters
    after parallel decoding runs.
    If the counters are saving the compounds as serialized objects/pickles,
    loading and merging will result in the duplication of all the DELibrary and
    BuildingBlock objects.
    Instead, you can save the compounds as low memory representations,
    merge on the string IDs,
    and reassign pointers to a single object in memory.
    This is after faster and memory efficient, and avoid using pickles,
    which can be a security risk
